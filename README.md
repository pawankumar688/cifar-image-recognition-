# CIFAR image recognition:
CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) image recognition is a popular machine learning task that involves classifying small, color images into one of several categories. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, while the CIFAR-100 dataset has 100 classes. The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the class of an image it has never seen before. This task is challenging due to the small size of the images and the complexity of distinguishing between similar-looking objects. CIFAR image recognition is commonly used to benchmark the performance of new machine learning algorithms and models.

### Purpose of this Project:
It's simple as I say always, This kind of project give me beter understanding of the concepts in deep learning, which will help alot solving real world issues, So this is important for me to Clear every besics before move to next stage.
## ðŸ›  Skills
Python, ML, data science, java, Ms Office


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm under graduat in IT I'm doing it from sindh  agriculture university form pakistan,
I'm very intersted in the filled of AI and it's subfilled Machine Learninig this project is my first project shows that what I have learned this few days, though it's not good as intermediate or master level even I can't compare it to other's and I'm stll learning, You may find some mistakes in my project and I Will be happy if you inform me about them but I'm still in leaning stage, And I will improve.
